\begin{abstract}
 We developped a light data acquisition system, based on DIM \cite{dim} and mongoose-cpp \cite{mongoose-cpp} frameworks. Providing binary data collection, events building, web accessible finite state machine and process control, it is well suit to manage distribute data source of laboratory or beam test .
\end{abstract}
\section{Introduction}

DIM\cite{dim} is an HEP acquisition framework developped in the DELPHI experiement. It embeds binary packet exchange in messages published by server and subscribed by client. It is light and TCP/IP based anc can be installed on nearly all currently used OS nowdays.

LEVBDIM is a simple acquisition framework where DIM is used to exchange structured binary buffer. It provides several functionnalities oftenly used in modern data acquisition:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Predefine structure of buffer
    \item publication of data source
    \item collection of data source
    \item Event building
    \item Finite State Machine
    \item Web access
    \item process control
\end{itemize}
All those functionnalities are mainly independant and can be used on their own. The last section of this documenation details a full example using all the capabilities of LEVBDIM.

\section{Installation}
\subsection{Packages}
Few standard packages are needed and can be found on any linux distributions: boost, jsoncpp, curl, git and scons

\begin{verbatim}
sudo apt-get -y install libboost-dev libboost-system-dev 
libboost-filesystem-dev libboost-thread-dev libjsoncpp-dev 
libcurl4-gnutls-dev git scons

\end{verbatim}
Two network libraries should be installed. The first one is DIM that can be download and compile from https://dim.web.cern.ch/dim/. The second one is used to give web access to the application, it's Mongoose-cpp\cite{mongoose-cpp} based on Mongoose \cite{mongoose}. One version is distributed with levbdim and can be compile before the installation.

\subsection{LEVBDIM installation}
\subsubsection{Getting the software}
The software is distributed on github\cite{github}. The master version is download with
 \begin{verbatim}
  git clone http://github.com/mirabitl/levbdim.git
\end{verbatim}
\subsubsection{Install the software}
\paragraph{Install Mongoose-cpp}
\begin{verbatim}
 cd levbdim \newline
 source web/mongoose.install
\end{verbatim}


\paragraph{Compile LEVBDIM}

\begin{verbatim}
  cd levbdim
  scons 
\end{verbatim}

\section{Library functionnalities}
\subsection{The Event builder}
Event building consists of merging various data source that collect event fragment at the same time. Each data source should consequently have a localisation tag and a time tag for each data fragment it provides. This fragment are published by a DimService and is centrally collected to build an event, i.e a collection of data fragment with an identical time tag.
