Hits tagging
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hits are separated in 3 categories:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
ISOLATED= The hit has no neighbours in a 9 cm radius sphere
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
EDGE = The hit belongs to a track segment in a 9 cm radius sphere
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
CORE= all other hits
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each hit defines a neighbouring sphere of 9 cm and a principal component
 anlysis is done on all neighbours.
 The ratio w of the 2 principal axis is then used to tag the hit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
w=0 → less than 3 neighbours, the hit is ISOLATED
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
w < 0.3 → the second axis is small, most probably hits are aligned along
 the first axis, the hit is an EDGE one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
w > 0.3 , the hit is in the CORE of the shower.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 shows the distribution of w for all the hits of a 60 GeV pion run.
 The 3 categories clearly exhibits.
 On figure

 the same ratio is shown for preselected muon candidates and preselected
 pions interaction in the same run.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
MIP tagging
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once hits are sorted in thos three categories.
 Clusters are built plane by plane by adding hits in plane distant from
 less than 4 cm to an existing cluster.
 Two collections are built.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Interaction
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 clusters are built from CORE hits and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

real
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 clusters from the other hits.
 Finally 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Interaction
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 clusters of less than 5 hits are moved in the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

real
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 collection and in paralell 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

real

\end_inset

 clusters of more than 5 hits are moved in the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

interaction
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

real
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 collection is then used to reconstructed track segments according to this
 algorithm:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Once again principal component anlysis is used for all clusters to find
 main direction in a 15 cm sphere around each point
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Each point is associated to existing tracks according to
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
if the track has at least 2 hits, the error of the extrapolation is taken
 and the point is added if
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
It is not the track path
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
it is less than 3 planes away from the end of the track
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
it is less than 5 sigma from the extrapolation
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
if the track has one hit
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
the track hit is one plane before
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
the principal axis of the cluster is used to build track parameter and point
 is added if it is less than 6 cm from the extrapolation
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
If no association is found, a new single hit track is created with track
 parameters deduced from the principal component analysis of its neighbouring.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The algorithm is run handling hits from the beam entry to the end of the
 calorimeter.
 At the end , a last pass is done trying to associate single hit tracks
 and previously unselected hits to valid segments.
 Finally all hits belonging to a cluster associated to a track segment is
 tagged MIP.
